### What we learned


We built the application using the Agile/Scrum methodology, which allowed us to maintain flexibility and adaptability throughout the development process. We utilized Jira for project management, ensuring that all tasks were tracked, prioritized, and completed efficiently, fostering clear communication and collaboration among team members. The interfaces were crafted based on Figma prototypes provided by team’s UX/UI designer, ensuring a user-centric design that met the project's requirements.
